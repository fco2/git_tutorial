chuka$ git branch  #lists all branches

chuka$ git checkout -b CHUKA_01_b  #create branch and checkout the branch in one line.

chuka$ git checkout <file name>  #this will undo changes in the current branch and overwrite them with changes in the master branch.

chuka$ git checkout master git-branching-syntax.txt  # explained above

chuka$ git diff CHUKA_01_a..master   # gives difference between two branches.

chuka$ git branch -m lovely_tutorial  # renaming/move a branch. You have to be on that branch to do this, or syntax is git branch -m <old branch name> <new branch name>

chuka$ git branch -d branch_to_delete  # delete a branch 

chuka$ git merge child_branch  # you must be on either master or parent branch to execute this command, and must have committed child_branch changes.

chuka$ git show --color-words #  this will show the differences between git branches.
