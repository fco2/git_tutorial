 // We are going to learn about branching, merging and remotes; navigating commit trees, stashing and setting up a remote.
 
 chuka$ git log #shows the commits made so far on branch 
 
 chuka$ git remote add origin file:///home/chuka/Desktop/Git-tutorial/   #adding local remote folder.
 
 chuka$ git ls-tree HEAD  #shows all the trees and blobs under the last commit branch.
 
 chuka$ git log --since=2019-04-15  #looking forward.
 
 chuka$ git log --until=2019-04-15  #looking backward.
 
 chuka$ git log
 
 chuka$ git push --set-upstream origin master  #used to push to local file repository
 
 chuka$ git log --oneline
 
 chuka$ git log --graph --all --oneline --decorate  # to show the graph of how things are merged.
 
 # How to resolve merge conflicts: 
 (1.) Do git merge --> it will say conflict, just go into file
 (2.) type "git show --color-words" in the command line console. It will show you the differences.
 (3.) Edit the file in question, save what needs to be saved and discard what needs to be discarded, then hit Save.
 (4.) Do a git add <file_name>.
 (5.) Do a git commit # No need for a commit message here... and it will continue merge for you.
